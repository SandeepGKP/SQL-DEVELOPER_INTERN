----------------------------------------------Subqueries and Nested Queries ---------------------------------------------------

##  Objective

This SQL project demonstrates the use of **subqueries** and **nested queries** in different clauses like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM`. It aims to build advanced query logic skills using scalar subqueries, correlated subqueries, and table subqueries.

---

##  Tools Used

-  DB Browser for SQLite  
-  MySQL Workbench

---

##  Tables

- **departments**: Contains department info
- **employees**: Contains employee details with salary and department ID
- **customers**: Customer data
- **orders**: Orders placed by customers

---

##  Features Demonstrated

1.  **Subquery in `SELECT` clause**  
2.  **Subquery in `WHERE` clause** using `IN`, `EXISTS`, and `=`  
3.  **Correlated Subqueries**  
4.  **Scalar Subqueries**  
5.  **Subquery in `FROM` clause (Derived Tables)**  
6.  **Aggregates inside subqueries** (e.g., `AVG()`, `MAX()`)

---

##  How to Run

1. Open your SQL tool (MySQL Workbench or DB Browser for SQLite).
2. Paste the script from `subqueries.sql`.
3. Run each query step-by-step or all at once.
4. Review the results and explore the logic.

---

##  Learning Outcome

- Understand how to nest queries logically.
- Use subqueries in practical business scenarios.
- Build efficient and readable SQL code using advanced query structures.
